## Another anime mod for tModLoader (but lore friendly)

**First of first you need to know here:**

I love Arifureta series and this mod is about it.
If you didn't watch this anime, or didn't read a novel, some of jokes/features/etc. won't be understandful.

**The second thing:**

I'm not a cool programmer with big experience in codding, so if you'll find a bug somewhere, let me know.

**The last thing:**

Mod adds some weapon from the Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou, based on anime version.For better navigation inside mod content, I added Yue companion, which can be summoned by using "Strange Item" into your inventory. Talk with her sometimes when needed to get access to the new content.

**The last last thing:**

It's pre-alpha for now. Lot's of content in progress, as a lore/items/other_stuff_i_dont_imagine. But I want to share my progress for now, to everyone. Thank you.
